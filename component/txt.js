// What is prep rendring:-
/* in reactjs if view source code then only only root id div is available and nextjs all thml page make show also.
means it advance pre render the html page. not done all is client side but react is client side dnoe
in react first load the div which is root id and then in browser create a different node and mount them in root element that is called hydaration
Next js:- pages are pre rendred html is already generated with the necessery data nad then send to the browser
Why pre redering:- 1> Improve performance 

generating html after fatching som data.
